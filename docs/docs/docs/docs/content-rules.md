## Content Hierarchy

When writing content, priorities are always:

1. Elegance
2. Clarity
3. Sensory texture
4. Confidence
5. Desire through suggestion

Speed, trendiness, and volume are never priorities.

---

## Sentence Style

- Short to medium-length sentences
- Calm, deliberate pacing
- Declarative statements over hype
- White space is allowed and encouraged

Avoid:
- Exclamation overload
- All-caps emphasis
- Clickbait phrasing

---

## Product-Centric Rule

Every piece of content must clearly serve at least one purpose:
- Showcase a material
- Communicate a feeling
- Support a buying decision

If it does not serve the product, it does not belong.

---

## Explicit Content Boundary

Content must always remain:
- Adult
- Consensual
- Tasteful
- satin lingerie inspired

We suggest through:
- Texture
- Fit
- Sensual alluring teasing movement
- Ultra fem sissy mood



---

## Consistency Check

Before publishing, ask:

- Does this feel calm and intentional?
- Does this match the visual universe?
- Would this still feel elegant a year from now?

If not, revise or discard.
